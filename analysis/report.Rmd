## Identification and description of individuals who remain unvaccinated 12 weeks after becoming eligible for vaccination  

Note: there is a very slight error in _study_definition.py_
The line^[https://github.com/opensafely/covid-unvaccinated-aimpaper/blob/96000eac92e8dca80a9792cc1b06ebb34e255fd2/analysis/study_definition.py#L52]:

`(age_2 >= 30 AND age_2 < 40 AND NOT (longres_group OR cev_group OR atrisk_group)`

should read:

`(age_2 >= 30 AND age_2 < 40 AND NOT (longres_group OR (cev_group AND NOT preg_elig_group) OR atrisk_group)`

The only errors would be women who satisfy the following criteria:

`cev_group AND preg_elig_group AND NOT atrisk_group`

I'm not sure it's even possible to be `cev_group AND NOT atrisk_group`, but can update and rerun if others think necessary.

}
```


### Methods  

Inclusion criteria:

- Individuals alive and registered at a single TPP practice between 1 January 2019 and 12 weeks after their date of eligibility for COVID-19 vaccination.
- Individuals satisfying the criteria for one of the following:
    - JCVI priority group 2, aged 80-120 years and not in a long term residential home (i.e. not in group 1, eligible from 8 December 2020)
    - JCVI priority group 9 (i.e. aged 50-54 years and not in groups 1-8, eligible from 19 March 2021)
    - JCVI priority group 11 (i.e. aged 30-39 years and not in groups 1-10, eligible from 13 - 26 May 2021)

For individuals in JCVI priority group 11, eligibility date was dependent on age.
All eligibility dates are given in Table 1.

Table 1. _Eligibility dates._
```{r elig_dates, include=TRUE}
read_csv(here::here("released_outputs", "output", "tables", "elig_dates_tibble.csv")) %>%
  arrange(elig_date) %>%
  rename("JCVI group"=jcvi_group, "Age band"=ageband, "Eligibility date"=elig_date) %>%
  my_flextable_1()
```

#### Outcome  

For the logistic regression the outcome was defined as:

- 0 if no record of COVID vaccination up until 12 weeks after eligibility date
- 1 if record of any brand of COVID vaccination any time up until 12 weeks after eligibility date (vaccination may occur before eligibility date)

For the survival analysis, the event of interest was the date of vaccination against COVID-19 (any brand).
Time zero was defined as 12 weeks after becoming eligible for COVID-19 vaccination.
Follow-up was measured in weeks from time zero to the event of interest.
Individuals were censored at the earliest of:

- date of death
- date of de-registration from TPP practice
- 28 September 2021 

#### Covariates  

The following clinical covariates were defined based on definitions given in _COVID-19: the green book, chapter 14a_^[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1018444/Greenbook_chapter_14a_16Sept21.pdf]: severe asthma, chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic neurological disease, diabetes (other endocrine disorders), immunosupressed, asplenia/dysfunction of spleen, severe mental illness.

Covariates were defined based on information recorded up until the individual's eligibility date, with the following exceptions:

- The the number of GP consultations that occurred between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019
- Vaccination against influenza between 1 September 2019 and 1 April 2020
- The following covariates relating to serious illness that may be contraindicate vaccination were defined based on information recorded between 2 weeks before the eligibility date up until 12 weeks after:
    - End-of-life care
    - Unplanned hospital admission
- The following covariates relating to COVID infection were split according to whether they occurred any time before the eligibility date or in the 12-week period after the eligibility date:
    - COVID +ve test before eligible
    - COVID +ve test while eligible
    - probable COVID before eligible
    - probable COVID while eligible
    - COVID hospitalisation before eligible
    - COVID hospitalisation while eligible

#### Analysis plan  

From the individuals that satisfy the inclusion criteria, and for each eligibility group:

- Identify all unvaccinated individuals (no vaccination within 12 weeks of their eligibility date).
- Randomly select 10% of the vaccinated individuals.
- For JCVI group 11 only, randomly select 10% of the unvaccinated individuals.

Within each JCVI group:

- Generate a summary table of the characteristics stratified by vaccinated/unvaccinated groups defined above (using inverse probability weights to correct for the random sampling of vaccinated patients).
- Fit univariate logistic regression models for vaccination within 12 weeks of eligibility date (using inverse probability weights to correct for the random sampling of vaccinated patients). Fit univariate logistic regression models for all covariates, with the exception of:
    - Region and continuous age
    - Any covariate with <10 individuals in a category
- For the unvaccinated group, fit a survival model for subsequent vaccination (i.e. after the 12-week eligibility period) and plot cumulative incidence of subsequent vaccination

### Results

I thought is was interesting that the odds ratios for covariates relating to COVID infection varied across the JCVI groups.
I've created Table 6 below for easy comparison.
Perhaps because people aged 80+ are less likely to recover from COVID and be well enough to receive a vaccine, while COVID infection in the 50-54 and 30-39 groups makes people take it more seriously and more likely to get vaccinated?

Table 6. _Comparison of odds ratios for covariates relating to COVID infection across the JCVI groups_
```{r, include=TRUE}
tables_list <- list()
for (g in c("02", "09", "11")) {
  tables_list[[g]] <- read_csv(file = here::here("released_outputs", "output", "tables", glue("table_{g}_unadj.csv"))) %>%
    filter(str_detect(characteristic, "COVID")) %>%
    rename(!! g := OR)
}

tables_list[["02"]] %>%
  left_join(tables_list[["09"]]) %>%
  left_join(tables_list[["11"]]) %>%
  rename(Characteristic=characteristic) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  add_header_row(
    values = c("", "Odds ratio of JCVI group:"),
    colwidths = c(1, 3)) %>%
    fontsize(size=10) %>%
    autofit() %>%
    theme_vanilla()
```
